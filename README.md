Datasets:
<ul>
  <li><b>Multi-electrode recording from Macquace V1 region in Primary Visual Cortex <a href = "https://crcns.org/data-sets/vc/pvc-8">[Link]</a>:</b> Contains recording from anasthesized monkey while natural images are shown to it. Great to learn decoding and receptive field information.</li>
